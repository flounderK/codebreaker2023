Find the correct processor datasheet, and then use it and the resources provided to enter which physical pins enable data to and from this device

Hints:

The pinout.svg has two voltage types. The gold/tan is 3.3v, the red is 5v.
The only additional resource you will need is the datasheet, or at least the relevant information from it


BCM2837 arm in ALT5 function mode

GPIO
14, 32, and 40 are UART TXD1
15, 33, and 41 are UART RXD1
(14 & 15) (32 & 33) (40 & 41) are UART TXD1 RXD1 in ALT5


Provide the correct physical pin number to power the GPIO header: P17
Provide a correct physical pin number to ground the board: P14
Provide the correct physical pin number for a UART transmit function: P37
Provide the correct physical pin number for a UART receive function: P38
