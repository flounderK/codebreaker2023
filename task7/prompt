Task 7 - There is Another - (Reverse Engineering, Exploitation)Points: 1200
Intelligence sources indicate with high probably there is a second device somewhere. We don't know where it is physically, but maybe you can find it's IP address somehow. We expect it is one of the up to 2^20 devices connected to the Blue Horizon Mobile network. Blue Horizon Mobile has explained that their internal network is segmented so all user devices are in the 100.64.0.0/12 IP range.

Figure out how the device communicates with the server you found in the previous task. It must only do so on-demand otherwise we would have probably discovered it sooner. This will probably require some in depth reverse engineering and some guess work. Use what you learn, plus intuition and vulnerability research and exploitation skills to extract information from the server somehow. Your goal is to determine the IP addresses for any devices that connected to the same server. There should be two addresses, one for the downed device, and another for the second device. Your jumpbox account has been updated to allow you to open TCP tunnels to the server (reconnect to enable the new settings). Remember the jumpbox internal IP is 100.127.0.2


Downloads:

SSH host key to authenticate the jumpbox (optional, same as before) (jumpbox-ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub)
SSH private key to authenticate to the jumpbox: user@external-support.bluehorizonmobile.com on TCP port 22 (same as before) (jumpbox.key)
Enter device IP addresses, one per line (don't guess)
